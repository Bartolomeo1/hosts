            A collection of hosts files for domain blocking. If you find something in a list that you believe is a mistake or breaks functionality,
            please <a href="https://github.com/lightswitch05/hosts/issues">open a ticket</a> and I'll consider removing it.
            Also, if you find an unblocked subdomain of a blocked root domain, please let me know so I can add it to a list.
        </p>

        <section>
            <h2><a href="lists/ads-and-tracking-extended.txt">Ads &amp; Tracking</a></h2>
            <p>
                A programmatically expanded list of hosts I've found to not be on other lists. This list is very reliable and I recommend using it.
                This list was last updated on <span id="ads-and-tracking-extended-date">October 09, 2019</span> and
                currently has <span id="ads-and-tracking-extended-count">81467</span> unique domains.

        <section>
            <h2><a href="lists/tracking-aggressive-extended.txt">Tracking Aggressive</a></h2>
            <p>
                A very aggressive block list for tracking, geo-targeting, &amp; ads. This list will likely break functionality,
                so do not use it unless you are willing to maintain your own whitelist. If you find something in this list that you think is a mistake,
                please <a href="https://github.com/lightswitch05/hosts/issues">open a ticket</a> and we can discuss it. Keep in mind that this is an aggressive list.
                This list was last updated on <span id="tracking-aggressive-extended-date">October 10, 2019</span> and
                currently has <span id="tracking-aggressive-extended-count">4055</span> unique domains.

                <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/19/open_source_insider_google_amp_bad_bad_bad/">Google's Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)</a>
                are taking over the web. Block AMP pages with this list. Since I use <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>,
                this list is pretty sparse and suggestions are welcome!
                This list was last updated on <span id="amp-hosts-extended-date">October 10, 2019</span> and
                currently has <span id="amp-hosts-extended-count">2038</span> unique domains.

            <h2><a href="lists/facebook-extended.txt">Facebook</a></h2>
            <p>
                A hosts file to block all facebook and facebook related services, including Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp.
                This is a pretty new list and I recommend using it with <a href="https://github.com/anudeepND/blacklist">anudeepND's</a>
                <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/blacklist/master/facebook.txt">Facebook list</a> as well to ensure full coverage.
                This list was last updated on <span id="facebook-extended-date">October 10, 2019</span> and
                currently has <span id="facebook-extended-count">2871</span> unique domains.

                Below is an image that says 'Not Blocking' that is blocked in all of my lists.
                If you see it, then you are not using one of my lists (or its older then July, 2019).
                If you do not see it, then you are using one of my lists (or a list that includes one of my lists).
                If you are unsure if its working or not, you could go directly to the
