<!-- 
Thank you for using my hosts lists. I appreciate feedback on this project, but I do expect you to put effort into your request. At the end of the day, this is my list and I maintain it for my usage. I'll address reasonable requests, but I cannot make everyone happy. This means you might have to whitelist a few things on your own. A list that breaks nothing is a list that blocks nothing.

**Got something to say?**

I appreciate feedback on this project - both positive and negative. Regardless of the nature of the comment, keep it respectful. I really don't want to create a 'code of conduct', but if you need some guidelines on your expected behavior, checkout this 'Hey Friend' song first https://vimeo.com/338708688

**False positive?**

Prove it. Do your research. I spend a lot of time working on this list, if you think you've found an issue, put the effort into it to prove it to me. Give me links to verify. I added the domain to the list, so I think it should be blocked. The burden of proof is on you. Please review these common issues before opening a ticket: https://github.com/lightswitch05/hosts#common-issues

**New domains to block?**

I generally do not want these types of requests. It takes a lot of extra time for me to verify. However, if you think you've found something that is missing: prove it. Give me links with detailed instructions on how to reproduce it. If I cannot reproduce it, then it will not be added.
