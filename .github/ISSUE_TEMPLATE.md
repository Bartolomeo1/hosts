<!-- 
Thank you for using my hosts lists. I appreciate feedback on this project, but I do expect you to put effort into your request. At the end of the day, this is my list and I maintain it for my usage. I'll address reasonable requests, but I cannot make everyone happy. This means you might have to whitelist a few things on your own. A list that breaks nothing is a list that blocks nothing.

* False positive?

Prove it. Do your research. I spend a lot of time working on this list, if you think you've found an issue, put the effort into it to prove it to me. Give me links to verify.

* New domains to block?

I generally do not want these types of requests. It takes a lot of extra time for me to verify. However, if you think you've found something that is missing: prove it. Give me links with detailed instructions on how to reproduce it. If I cannot reproduce it, then it will not be added.
